### Part 1 - Planning the Smart Contract
- There is one admin and the admin can give approval to producers to create and post movies
- A viewer can view the information of a movie and tip it if interested
- The tipped amount directly goes to the account of the producer
- The campaign runs until the required amount is raised
- The tipper can't send more than the required amount
- When the required amount is reached, the movie will be disabled for tipping
